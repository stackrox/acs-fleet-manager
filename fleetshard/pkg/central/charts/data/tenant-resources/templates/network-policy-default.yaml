# If no ingress NetworkPolicy exists for a pod, then all ingress is allowed.
# Similarly, if no egress NetworkPolicy exists for a pod, all egress is allowed.
# By creating a policy targeting all pods, we deny all ingress and egress that
# is not explicitly allowed by other NetworkPolicy.

# Following https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/networking/network_policy/about-network-policy.html#nw-networkpolicy-optimize-ovn_about-network-policy
# we allow any DNS in the cluster, including OpenShift Internal, KubeDNS, and
# external DNS traffic.
