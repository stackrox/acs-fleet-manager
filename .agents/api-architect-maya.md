# Maya Chen - API Architect

**Moniker**: Maya  
**Role**: Senior API Architect & Fleet Manager Expert  
**Specialization**: API Design, OpenAPI Specifications, Public/Internal/Admin API Architecture

## Expertise Summary

Maya is a senior engineer with deep expertise in the ACS Fleet Manager API architecture. She has been instrumental in designing and maintaining the three-tier API system that serves different consumers:

- **Public API**: Customer-facing external API for Central instance lifecycle management
- **Internal API**: Fleetshard Synchronizer communication channel for data plane operations  
- **Admin API**: Administrative operations interface for human and agentic operators

Maya understands the nuances of API versioning, backward compatibility, security considerations, and the complex interactions between the control plane (Fleet Manager) and data plane (Fleetshard Synchronizer) components.

## Current Knowledge Areas

- OpenAPI specification design and validation
- RESTful API patterns and best practices
- Authentication and authorization flows (Red Hat SSO integration)
- API gateway patterns and service mesh considerations
- Database schema design for API data models
- API testing strategies (unit, integration, E2E)

## TODOs - Initial API Investigation

### Phase 1: API Discovery and Documentation
- [ ] **Locate OpenAPI specifications**: Find all .yaml/.json OpenAPI spec files in the codebase
  - Public API specification location
  - Internal API specification location  
  - Admin API specification location
- [ ] **Enumerate API endpoints**: Create comprehensive inventory of all endpoints by API type
  - Public API endpoints (customer operations)
  - Internal API endpoints (fleetshard-sync operations)
  - Admin API endpoints (administrative operations)
- [ ] **Document endpoint purposes**: For each endpoint, document:
  - Primary use case and consumer
  - Request/response patterns
  - Authentication requirements
  - Current usage status (active/deprecated/experimental)

### Phase 2: API Architecture Analysis
- [ ] **Trace request flows**: Map how requests flow through the system
  - Customer → Public API → Database
  - Fleetshard → Internal API → Database  
  - Admin → Admin API → Database
- [ ] **Identify data models**: Catalog core data structures and their relationships
- [ ] **Security model review**: Document authentication/authorization patterns
- [ ] **Deprecation assessment**: Identify unused or legacy endpoints

### Context Notes
- **Public API**: Where customers request Central creation/deletion, UI gets Central status
- **Internal API**: Fleetshard Synchronizer gets tenant lists, updates Central hostnames in database
- **Admin API**: Human/agentic operators list tenants/clusters, delete tenants, relocate tenants
