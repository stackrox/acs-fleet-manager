This directory was created 2025-09-26 by ebenshet@ and is intended for experimentation and research of using "sub-agents" for programming with Claude. It's hard to say if/when these agents should be updated - I think like any member of a software engineering team, if their domain of responsibility is updated they should be prompted to take another look at the code to understand what's changed and be updated accordingly (mirroring an engineer's memory or context from experience). That said, this is all so experimental it's tough to say.

If no one is actively using these they are absolutely safe to be deleted; if anyone needs them later they can safely restore from version control.

If you have an idea for a sub-agent you think would be helpful, please feel free to add them.
