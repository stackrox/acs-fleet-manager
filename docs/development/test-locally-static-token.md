# How to test different claims using the static token

The static token's payload is located under `config/static-token-payload.json`.
It defines a sample org_admin with full administrative rights on the private API of the fleet manager.

The token can be used seamlessly by simply adding it in bearer format to API requests. It will allow access to all APIs.

It's additionally also used within the fleetshard synchronizer for developing without requiring sso.redhat.com.

If you simply want to use the token, you can find a non-expiring static token within Bitwarden (`ACS Fleet* static token`).

In case you want to change the static token, follow the steps below (you can skip optional steps if you do not want to
re-create the JWKS files. You will find the JWKS files in Bitwarden `ACS Fleet* Static token JWKS`):

1. (optional): You have to create JSON web keypair. For simplicity, you can use [mkjwk.org](http://mkjwk.org/) to generate the keypair.
2. (optional): Use the following options to generate your keypair:
```
Key Size:   2048
Key Use:    Signature
Alogirhtm:  RS256 RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 using SHA-256
Key ID:     SHA-256
Show X.509: Yes
```
3. (optional): Copy the values of the `Public Key (X.509 PEM Format), Private Key (X.509 PEM Format)` fields.
4. (optional): Replace the values within BitWarden's `ACS Fleet* Static token JWKS` item respectively with the previously copied values.
5. (optional): Copy the value of the `Public Key` field within [mkjwk.org](http://mkjwk.org) and append the value to the array within `config/jwks-file-static.json`.
6. Open [jwt.io](https://jwt.io), and paste the last value of the array within `config/jwks-file-static.json` into the `HEADER` field in the decoded column.
7. Copy the values of from Bitwarden's `ACS Fleet* Static token JWKS` item respectively, pasting them into the `VERIFY SIGNATURE` fields.
8. Copy the payload data contained within `config/static-token-payload.json` and adjust the payload to your liking.
9. Once finished copy the payload data and update the value within `config/static-token-payload.json`.
   Use `config/static-token-admin-payload.json` for admin static token
10. Also, ensure that the ConfigMap `fleet-manager-authentication` is up-to-date, specifically the `jwks-file-static.json` item.

If you have re-created the JWKS files, ensure that fleet manager is re-started with the new values of the `config/jwks-file-static.json`.
This also includes any staging instances.

Locally, you have the option to explicitly set the JWKS file to be used by the fleet manager using the following flag:
```shell
./fleet-manager --jwks-file path/to/your/file
```
